# 👋 About Me

Hello! I’m a student at **Central Mindanao University (CMU)** in the Philippines.  
I love building desktop, mobile, and web applications that are simple, meaningful, and helpful to my community.  
I explore a wide range of technologies — from VB.NET and MySQL to Flutter, Firebase, and Laravel.

---

## 🎯 Focus Areas

- Building student-friendly desktop and mobile apps that can be completed within ~4 months.
- Improving logic and programming thinking (proofs, fallacies, Modus Ponens, Transitivity, etc.).
- Developing cross-platform projects, including:
  - **CMU Map App** – real-time campus navigation with search, marker info, popups, and feedback.
  - **Flutter Weather App** – dark mode, detailed forecasts, API integration (OpenWeatherMap).
  - **Laravel Product Management** – CSV/Excel/PDF export, Blade refactoring.
  - **VB.NET Student Records App** – file-based storage using controls like ListView and TextBoxes.

## 📌 Current Projects

### ✅ **CMU Map**
A navigation app for freshmen at CMU.  
**Issue being fixed:** When My Location is enabled, the map always resets to the user's location.

### ✅ **SOS Message Sender**
Sends an SOS SMS to a predefined number.  
**Current behavior:** Works for my own number (09076756416) but not other numbers.

### ✅ **Plant Sampling Database**
Designing a normalized ERD + MySQL database for biodiversity and ecosystem data.

### ✅ **Flutter Weather App**
Displays forecasts, dark mode, and detailed daily weather info.

### ✅ **Laravel Product Manager**
Export to CSV, Excel, PDF; refactoring Blade templates for cleaner architecture.

## ✅ My Coding Preferences

- I **prefer not** to create additional XML files in Android unless needed.
- I **prefer not** to update dependencies unless required.
- I keep variable/control names **as-is** for clarity (e.g., `connection`, `sqlQuery`, `txtEmailAdd`, `txtStudentNum`).
- I like clean, simple, consistent UI and code structure.
